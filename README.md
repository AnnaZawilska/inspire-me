# inspire-me
<br>
Collaboratively write poetry with your machine, using a simple model and a collection of your favourite poetry.
<br><br>
The model is trained on a sample of your favourite poetry, and provides you with words of inspiration. You use the words to evoke imagery and write the final poetry.
