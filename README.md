# inspire-me
<br>
Collaboratively write poetry with your machine, using a simple model and a collection of your favourite poetry.
<br><br>
The model is trained on a sample of your favourite poetry, and provides you with words of inspiration. You use the words to evoke imagery and write the final poetry.

## Get autocomplete module

Available here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autocomplete/0.0.104

    pip install autocomplete
Create the text file with the poetry you want as inspiration, and point to that file in autocomplete.models.train_bigtxt()
The training data set I used is given in this repo as training_set_poetry_plath.txt.

## Example poetry

Here's a poem my computer and I co-wrote:

*the burning fire as the outsiders entered on the narrowing roads*<br>
*barrels stacked in the dark shadows*<br>
*crowds bold and austere*<br>
<br><br>
*their cries unintelligible, bodies creating an island*<br>
*the moon coming up, big yellow bulb*<br>
<br><br>
*the large housesâ€™ windows illuminated*<br>
*chidren crowded up against the windows*<br>
*babies fallen asleep upstairs, desultory*<br>
<br><br>
*among the thump*<br>
*thump*<br>
*thump*<br>
<br><br>
*a top barrel rolls lurches over*<br>
*clunk*<br>
*on the ground*<br>
<br><br>
*and rolls away to the distance*<br>
